## Automated Workflow Integration

### FileWatcher Integration
```markdown
## During Active TDD Session:
1. **File Change Detection**: Monitor source and test files
2. **Smart Test Selection**: Run relevant tests based on changed files
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Display test results immediately
4. **Coverage Tracking**: Update coverage metrics continuously
5. **Quality Validation**: Check code formatting on each change

## FileWatcher Configuration for TDD Sessions:
- Debounce delay: 2 seconds (optimal for TDD rhythm)
- Auto-test execution: ENABLED
- Coverage analysis: ENABLED with 90% threshold
- Smart test mapping based on Drawing Machine patterns
```

### Integration with Existing TDD Commands
```markdown
## Enhanced Command Behavior During Sessions:

/tdd-start [feature]:
- Automatically starts session if none active
- Integrates with session tracking
- Updates session metadata

/tdd-test [test_path]:
- Records test execution in session log
- Updates coverage metrics
- Validates TDD methodology compliance

/tdd-iterate:
- Tracks Red-Green-Refactor cycle completion
- Updates session progress metrics
- Provides intelligent next step recommendations
```

## Session State Tracking

### Real-time Metrics Collection
```markdown
## Tracked Metrics:
- **Coverage Progression**: Track coverage % over time
- **Test Pass/Fail Rates**: Monitor test stability
- **TDD Cycle Compliance**: Validate Red-Green-Refactor adherence
- **Development Velocity**: Tests/hour, coverage/hour metrics
- **Quality Trends**: Code quality scores over time

## Session History:
- Timestamp-based checkpoint trail
- Coverage progression graphs
- Test execution timeline
- Performance benchmarks
```

### TDD Methodology Compliance
```markdown
## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Validation:

RED Phase Detection:
- New failing test added
- Test failure count increased
- No implementation changes yet

GREEN Phase Detection:  
- Previously failing test now passes
- Minimal implementation added
- No refactoring changes yet

REFACTOR Phase Detection:
- All tests still passing
- Code structure improvements made
- No new functionality added

## Compliance Scoring:
- 100%: Perfect TDD methodology adherence
- 80-99%: Good TDD practices with minor deviations
- 60-79%: Acceptable TDD with improvement needed
- <60%: TDD methodology not followed properly
```

## Quality Gate Enforcement

### Drawing Machine Proven Standards
```markdown
## Quality Gates (Based on 97.6% Success Rate):

1. **Test Coverage ≥ 90%**
   - Proven effective in Drawing Machine project
   - Validated across foundational models
   - Enforced at session checkpoints and completion

2. **All Tests Must Pass (100%)**
   - Zero tolerance for failing tests at completion
   - Temporary failures allowed during development
   - Final validation requires clean test suite

3. **TDD Methodology Compliance ≥ 80%**
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle adherence
   - Tests-first development approach
   - Proper test isolation and structure

4. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Black formatting compliance
   - Ruff linting standards

```

### Prevention Mechanisms
```markdown
## Session Completion Blockers:
- Coverage below 90% threshold
- Any failing tests remaining
- TDD methodology compliance below 80%
- Code quality standards not met
- Missing or inadequate documentation

## Override Conditions:
- Explicit approval for experimental features
- Legacy code integration scenarios
- Emergency hotfix situations (with documentation)

## Example TDD Session Workflow

### Complete Development Cycle Example
```bash
# 1. Start new TDD session
/tdd-session-start motor_controller

# 2. System initializes session, starts FileWatcher
# Session Status: INITIALIZED
# Coverage: 0% | Tests: 0/0 | Phase: SETUP

# 3. Developer writes first failing test (RED phase)
# FileWatcher detects change, runs tests automatically
# Session Status: RED | Coverage: 0% | Tests: 0/1 | Phase: RED

# 4. Developer implements minimal code to pass test (GREEN phase)  
# FileWatcher detects change, runs tests automatically
# Session Status: GREEN | Coverage: 85% | Tests: 1/1 | Phase: GREEN

# 5. Developer refactors code while maintaining tests (REFACTOR phase)
# FileWatcher validates tests still pass
# Session Status: REFACTOR | Coverage: 87% | Tests: 1/1 | Phase: REFACTOR

# 6. Checkpoint progress
/tdd-session-checkpoint
# Checkpoint saved: 1 TDD cycle completed, 87% coverage

# 7. Continue development cycles...
# Add more tests, implement features, refactor

# 8. Check session status
/tdd-session-status
# Session Status: GREEN | Coverage: 94% | Tests: 12/13 | 4 cycles completed

# 9. Complete session when ready
/tdd-session-complete
# Quality Gates: ✅ Coverage (94%) ✅ Tests (13/13) ✅ Quality ✅ TDD Compliance
# Session completed successfully with comprehensive report generated
```

This comprehensive TDD session management workflow leverages the proven Drawing Machine methodology to provide automated, intelligent development assistance within Claude Code, maintaining the high standards that achieved 97.6% test success rate.
